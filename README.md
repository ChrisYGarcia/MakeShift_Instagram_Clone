This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Christopher Garcia

MakeShift Instagram clone powered by React.js

I used React.js for the UI framework and material-ui for the CSS framework.
I installed and used the JavaScript library Axios in order to send Ajax calls to the API.
I used Axios because it was more browser-supported than other tools/libraries such as fetch().
I was able to use ES2015 syntax because CRA(Create React App) comes with Babel included, as well as webpack.
